# Hostname and port of the pcopy server

# For servers: This address is advertised to clients. It is not strictly necessary to provide a value here, but

# Address and port to use to bind the server (HTTPS and HTTP). To bind to all addresses, you may omit the address
# and only pass the port, e.g. :2586. If no protocol suffix (/https or /http) is provided, /https is assumed.

# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.

# Format:  [ADDR]:PORT[/https|/http]
