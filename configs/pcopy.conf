# pcopy config file

# Hostname and port of the pcopy server
#
# For servers: This address is advertised to clients. It is not strictly necessary for normal copy/paste operations, 
# but required for the easy-install process via 'pcopy invite'. If PORT is not defined, the default port 1986 is used. 
# 
# Format:    HOST[:PORT]
# Default:   None
#
# ServerAddr

# Address and port to use to bind the server. To bind to all addresses, you may omit the address,
# e.g. :2586.
#
# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.
#
# Format:  [ADDR]:PORT
# Default: :1986
#
# ListenAddr :1986

# If a key is defined, clients need to auth whenever they want copy/paste values
# to the clipboard. A key is derived from a password and can be generated using
# the 'pcopy keygen' command.
# 
# Format:  SALT:KEY (both base64 encoded)
# Default: None
#
# Key

# Path to the TLS certificate used for the HTTPS traffic. If not set, the config file path (with 
# a .crt extension) is assumed to be the path to the certificate, e.g. server.crt (if the config
# file is server.conf). 
#
# For servers: This certificate is served to clients.
# For clients: If a certificate is present, it is used as the only allowed certificate to communicate
#              with a server (cert pinning). 
#
# Format:  /some/path/to/server.crt (PEM formatted)
# Default: Config path, but with .crt extension
#
# CertFile

# Path to the private key for the matching certificate. If not set, the config file path (with 
# a .key extension) is assumed to be the path to the private key, e.g. server.key (if the config
# file is server.conf).
#
# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.
#
# Format:  /some/path/to/server.key (PEM formatted)
# Default: Config path, but with .key extension
#
# KeyFile

# Path to the directory in which the clipboard resides. If not set, this defaults to 
# the path /var/cache/pcopy.
#
# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.
#
# Format:  /some/folder
# Default: /var/cache/pcopy
#
# ClipboardDir /var/cache/pcopy

# Duration after which clipboard contents will be deleted unless they are updated before. 
# To disable, set to 0.
#
# This is a server-only option (pcopy serve). It has no effect for client commands.
#
# Format:  <number>(hms)
# Default: 7d  
#
# ExpireAfter 7d
